Landslide Guardian: 
Abstract:
The Landslide Guardian empowers communities with real-time risk awareness, guides them to
safety through dynamic escape routes, and expedites rescue efforts through automated notifications.
This comprehensive approach aims to significantly reduce casualties, minimize damage, and
provide crucial support during critical moments.
Problem Statement: Landslides pose a constant threat to lives and infrastructure, often striking
suddenly and leaving communities unprepared. Existing warning systems lack real-time data
integration, personalized escape routes, and comprehensive communication tools, hindering
effective response and rescue efforts.
Solution Approach: This project introduces the Landslide Guardian, a multi-layered system
leveraging real-time data and advanced technology to empower communities and expedite rescue.
Key features:

• Data Acquisition: Sensor networks collecting geological data (moisture content, slope
movement, etc.) coupled with weather and seismic monitoring systems.

• AI-powered Prediction: Machine learning algorithms analyzing real-time data to predict
landslide risk with dynamic accuracy.

• Adaptive Warning System: Multi-level alerts via mobile apps, sirens, and community
broadcasts triggered based on predicted risk, ensuring timely and location-specific warnings.

• Dynamic Escape Route Generation: Real-time geospatial analysis creates personalized,
safe routes for individuals considering evolving risk and individual location.

• Automated Rescue Notification: AI triggers immediate alerts to rescue teams upon
detecting high landslide risk, minimizing response time.

• Emergency Communication System: Integrated chatbox offering first-aid instructions and
mental health support to trapped individuals, aiding them while awaiting rescue.
